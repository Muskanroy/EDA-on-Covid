 In this repository the visualization of stats and important graphs are obtained in order to 
better understand the relation of coronavirus and impactful graphs which can be used for advanced studies.  
## Introduction of Covid-19  

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
a pandemic[1]. A global coordinated effort is needed to stop the further spread of the virus. 
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness such as respiratory diseases or 
gastrointestinal diseases.
A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been identified in humans previously.
Once scientists determine exactly what coronavirus it is, they give it a name (as in the case 
of COVID-19, the virus causing it is SARS-CoV-2).
Coronaviruses got their name from the way that they look under a microscope. The virus consists
of a core of genetic material surrounded by an envelope with protein spikes. This gives it the 
appearance of a crown. The word Corona means “crown” in Latin.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic[12], meaning that the viruses are transmitted between animals and humans.
## Clinical Presentation
Typically Coronaviruses present with respiratory symptoms. Among those who will become infected, some will show no symptoms. Those who do develop symptoms may have a mild to moderate, but self-limiting disease with symptoms similar to the seasonal flu[14]. Symptoms may include: 

Respiratory symptoms
Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath
Breathing difficulties
Fatigue
Sore throat
